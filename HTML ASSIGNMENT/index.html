        At the end of the day, you are solely responsible for your success and
        your failure. And the sooner you realize that, you accept that, and
      </p>
      <p>
        integrate that into your work ethic, you will start being successful. As
        long as you blame others for the reason you aren't where you want to be,
      </p>
      <p>you will always be a failure.</p>
